Here’s a detailed, copy-paste-ready plan you can give directly to a Replit agent. It assumes web app first (React/Next.js or plain React + backend), one main page, and filters for: rumors, injuries, latest games, news across basketball, football, soccer.

⸻

Title

Build a One-Page Sports Intel Dashboard with Filters (Basketball, Football, Soccer)

⸻

High-Level Goal

Create a single-page web app that shows curated sports information for:
	•	Sports: Basketball, Football, Soccer
	•	Content types (filters):
	•	Rumors
	•	Injuries
	•	Latest Games
	•	News (confirmed / general)

The goal: a clean, information-only dashboard—no memes, no jokes—where users can quickly filter and scan key updates.

For now, you can use mock/static data or simple in-memory data structures instead of wiring to real external APIs. Just design everything so it can be replaced later with live data providers.

⸻

Tech Stack & Project Setup

Front-end:
	•	React (with Vite or Create React App) OR Next.js
	•	Use a simple component structure.
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS or a lightweight CSS framework (or basic CSS modules if easier).

Back-end (if needed for structure):
	•	Lightweight Node.js + Express API
	•	Or skip real backend and simulate with local JSON data / mock services, but design the structure as if an API exists.

Key requirement:
Everything is presented on one main page (single route); filters change the displayed data, not the URL.

⸻

Data Model (Conceptual Only—Can Be In-Memory for Now)

Create clear data structures for Replit agent to implement. For now, these can be JS objects/arrays or TypeScript interfaces.

1. Sport
	•	id (string): "basketball" | "football" | "soccer"
	•	name (string)

2. Game

Represents a single game (latest or recent).
	•	id (string)
	•	sportId (string)
	•	league (string) – e.g., "NBA", "NFL", "EPL"
	•	homeTeam (string)
	•	awayTeam (string)
	•	homeScore (number | null)
	•	awayScore (number | null)
	•	status (string) – "upcoming" | "live" | "finished"
	•	startTime (ISO string)

3. InfoItem (Unified Data Item for Rumors/Injuries/News)

Use one generic type for all non-game information so filtering is easy.

Fields:
	•	id (string)
	•	sportId (string) – "basketball" | "football" | "soccer"
	•	type (string) – "rumor" | "injury" | "news"
	•	title (string)
	•	description (string)
	•	player (string | null)
	•	team (string | null)
	•	source (string) – e.g., "ESPN", "The Athletic", "Beat Reporter"
	•	sourceUrl (string | null)
	•	timestamp (ISO string)
	•	tag (string | null) – e.g., "trade", "contract", "out tonight"

4. Data Grouping

For the MVP:
	•	A list/array of games (latest and recent) per sport.
	•	A list/array of info items per sport (rumors, injuries, news).

Replit agent should create a small realistic seed dataset with entries for each combination:
	•	Rumor + Injury + News + Latest Game for each of:
	•	Basketball
	•	Football
	•	Soccer

⸻

One-Page UI Layout

The app must be one main dashboard page with the following structure.

1. Top Bar / Header
	•	App title, e.g., “Sports Intel Board”.
	•	Optional small subtitle: “Pure stats and updates. No memes. Basketball • Football • Soccer”.

2. Filter Bar (Critical)

A horizontal filter bar at the top of the page, containing:
	1.	Sport Filter (multi-select or single-select)
Options:
	•	Basketball
	•	Football
	•	Soccer
Implementation details:
	•	Use toggle buttons or pill-style buttons.
	•	User can select one sport at a time for simplicity or allow multiple; design it so the code supports multiple but UI can be single-select if easier.
	•	Default selection: All sports or Basketball.
	2.	Info Type Filter (multi-select)
Options:
	•	Rumors
	•	Injuries
	•	Games
	•	News
Behavior:
	•	Checkboxes or pill buttons.
	•	At least one type is always selected.
	•	Default: All types selected.
	3.	Time Filter (simple)
Options:
	•	Last 24 hours
	•	Last 3 days
	•	Last 7 days
For mock data, just compare timestamp against Date.now() and filter accordingly. If easier, you can ignore strict correctness and just demonstrate the filtering.
	4.	Search Box (optional but useful)
	•	Text input to search by player name or team name.
	•	Filters the currently displayed items.

3. Content Area

Below the filter bar, show two main sections stacked vertically:

A. “Latest Games” Section
	•	Title: “Latest Games”
	•	Show a list of Game Cards filtered by:
	•	Selected sport(s)
	•	Type filter includes “Games”
	•	Time filter (game start time within range)

Game Card layout:
	•	Sport + League label (small text)
	•	Teams: HOME vs AWAY
	•	Score (if finished / live; show - if upcoming)
	•	Status: LIVE, FINAL, or Starts at [time]
	•	Time / date

Use a compact layout so multiple games can be seen at once.

B. “News & Updates” Section
Below games:
	•	Title: “News, Injuries & Rumors”
	•	Show a vertical list of Info Cards, filtered by:
	•	Selected sport(s)
	•	Selected info types (type IN ['rumor', 'injury', 'news'] according to filter)
	•	Time filter
	•	Search keyword (matches player or team or title)

Info Card layout:

Each card should display:
	•	A small badge for type:
	•	Rumor (maybe yellow-ish badge)
	•	Injury (red badge)
	•	News (blue/neutral badge)
	•	Sport badge: Basketball, Football, or Soccer
	•	Title
	•	Subtitle/detail line with:
	•	Player (if any)
	•	Team (if any)
	•	Description (short) – truncated to a few lines
	•	Source + timestamp (e.g., “ESPN · 2h ago”)
	•	If sourceUrl exists, a “View Source” link

Order: newest first by timestamp.

⸻

Filtering Logic (Behavior Description for Agent)

The filtering pipeline for the Replit agent to implement:
	1.	Start from all items (games + info items).
	2.	Apply sport filter:
	•	If specific sports selected, keep items where sportId is in selected list.
	3.	Apply type filter:
	•	For games: only show them if the “Games” filter is active.
	•	For info items: only keep those where type is in selected types (rumor, injury, news).
	4.	Apply time filter:
	•	Convert timestamp or startTime to Date.
	•	Compare against current time, keep only those within chosen range.
	5.	Apply search filter:
	•	If search text is non-empty:
	•	Convert search text and fields to lowercase.
	•	For games: match on team names.
	•	For info items: match on title, player, team, description.

The result is two filtered arrays:
	•	filteredGames
	•	filteredInfoItems

Render those in their respective sections.

⸻

State Management Plan

On the frontend, maintain a simple state object:
	•	selectedSports: string[] – e.g., ["basketball", "football"]
	•	selectedTypes: string[] – e.g., ["games", "injury", "news", "rumor"]
	•	selectedTimeRange: "24h" | "3d" | "7d"
	•	searchQuery: string

Whenever the user changes any filter:
	•	Update the respective state
	•	Recompute filtered lists (this can be done with useMemo or a helper function)

⸻

Steps for the Replit Agent (Explicit Instructions)

Step 1 – Initialize Project
	1.	Create a new web project (React with Vite or CRA, or Next.js).
	2.	Add a basic folder structure:
	•	/src/components
	•	/src/data
	•	/src/hooks (optional)
	3.	Add Tailwind CSS or basic styling setup.

Step 2 – Seed Data
	1.	In /src/data, create files like:
	•	sports.ts or sports.js
	•	games.ts
	•	infoItems.ts
	2.	Fill them with mock data that looks realistic:
	•	For each sport (basketball, football, soccer), add:
	•	3–5 recent or upcoming games.
	•	6–10 info items (mix of rumors, injuries, news).
	•	Use timestamps within last 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days so filters can be tested.

Step 3 – Create Types/Interfaces (Optional but Preferred)

If using TypeScript, define:
	•	Sport
	•	Game
	•	InfoItem

in a types.ts file and use them throughout.

Step 4 – Build the Main Page Layout
	1.	Create App.tsx or MainPage.tsx as the single page.
	2.	Add:
	•	Header component: Header
	•	Filter bar component: Filters
	•	Content area with:
	•	GamesSection
	•	InfoSection

Each section should accept props that are pre-filtered arrays of items.

Step 5 – Implement Filters Component

Filters should:
	•	Receive current state values and setters via props:
	•	selectedSports
	•	setSelectedSports
	•	selectedTypes
	•	setSelectedTypes
	•	selectedTimeRange
	•	setSelectedTimeRange
	•	searchQuery
	•	setSearchQuery

And render:
	•	Sport buttons or checkboxes (Basketball, Football, Soccer)
	•	Type filters (Rumors, Injuries, Games, News)
	•	Time range selector
	•	Search input

All interactions should update the state in the parent (App).

Step 6 – Implement Filtering Logic

In the main page component:
	1.	Import raw data arrays (allGames, allInfoItems).
	2.	Create a helper function or useMemo to compute filteredGames and filteredInfoItems based on:
	•	selectedSports
	•	selectedTypes
	•	selectedTimeRange
	•	searchQuery
	3.	Pass filteredGames to GamesSection and filteredInfoItems to InfoSection.

Step 7 – Build Game Cards and Info Cards

GameCard:
	•	Props: one Game.
	•	Show:
	•	Sport/league
	•	Teams and scores
	•	Status and start time.

InfoCard:
	•	Props: one InfoItem.
	•	Show:
	•	Badge for type (rumor/injury/news).
	•	Sport label.
	•	Title, player, team.
	•	Short description, truncated.
	•	Source and relative time (e.g., “2h ago”; for now a simple time string is fine).
	•	“View Source” link if sourceUrl present.

Step 8 – Styling
	•	Use a dark or neutral theme, similar to a data dashboard.
	•	Make the filter bar sticky at the top (optional).
	•	Make cards compact, aligned, and scrollable.

Step 9 – Extensibility Hooks

Design the code so that later:
	•	The static data arrays can be replaced by API responses.
	•	The filtering logic doesn’t change; only the data provider changes.

This means:
	•	Keep a clear separation between data fetching layer and filtering/rendering.

For now, just simulate data fetching by importing from /src/data.

⸻

If you want, after the Replit agent generates the initial version from this plan, we can iterate on:
	•	Making the data provider asynchronous (simulate API).
	•	Adding badges for “verified source” vs “speculative rumor”.
	•	Eventually adding real API integrations.
